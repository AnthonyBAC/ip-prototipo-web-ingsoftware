This project is a **frontend admin dashboard prototype** developed as part of my coursework at the institute where Iâ€™m currently studying **Computer Engineering**.

The goal of this project is to visually demonstrate the structure and interface of a web-based system for administrative use.

It was built using only **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on layout, UI elements, and responsive design for desktops.
